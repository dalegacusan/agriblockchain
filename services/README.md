## If contract is not yet deployed: 

First deploy a blockchain (Ganache should deploy at localhost:7545)

Go to truffle directory and run
```bash
truffle migrate
```

## Prerequisites
Make sure the blockchain is up and contract is deployed at localhost:7545

Copy and paste the contract address to .env



## Connect to the blockchain

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will open localhost:8081

Test the api with Postman using the addresses provided by Ganache
