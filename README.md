## General Information

The challenge was to create an application (web or mobile) to help the agricultural sector have an efficient farm-to-market process by utilizing blockchain technology.

Our team's solution is to connect the involved and interested parties: the Farmers, NGOs and Donors/Sponsors. We provide a way for the programs of the NGOs to be more accessible.

Bayanihan will help
* Widen the sponsor and produce supplier network of NGOs
* Build program portfolio of NGOs
* Establish trust to NGOs and enforce transparency of program expenditures
* Enable farmers to sell produce directly to NGOs
* Program participation can help farmers establish creditworthiness

`In fulfillment of UBP Xcellerator's Blockchain Development Program`

* MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS)
* Solidity
* Ganache

## Live Demo
